## **PART 10: QUICK REFERENCE CARDS**



### **EMERGENCY BACKUP PLANS**

- 5-minute walk
- Cleanser + moisturizer + SPF
- Protein bar
- That's it!

**Busy Day**:

---

## **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**

1. **Start where you are** - Even 10% is better than 0%
2. **Progress isn't linear** - Bad days are normal
3. **Rest is productive** - Especially with chronic conditions
4. **Modify everything** - This is YOUR routine
5. **Consistency > Perfection** - Doing something daily matters more than doing it perfectly

This routine is designed to work WITH your conditions, not against them. PCOS and Crohn's are both inflammatory conditions that respond well to consistent, gentle interventions. The Asian wellness practices included here have centuries of use for hormonal and digestive issues.

Remember: You don't have to do everything at once. Pick what feels manageable and build from there. Even just the spearmint tea and walking could make a significant difference in your PCOS symptoms.

You've got this! 💪
